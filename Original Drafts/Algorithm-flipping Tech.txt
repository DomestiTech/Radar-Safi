    <h2> Algorithm-flipping Technology Subsystem Functions </h2>

      <h3> Mode Selection </h3>

        <p> On of the most outstanding mistakes in modern democratic systems is foreign imposition. In this error, we have ruling parties because of numbers and the philosophy of majority imposing their way on others. This does not have to be the case. Sensitive systems can learn to channel exceptions properly because depending on need and best practices towards maximization of goodwill.

        <p> In this technology, sets of algorithms are listed across a procedure. Then the artificial intelligence chooses one by matching requirements to respective outputs from functions like in an automatic dial built from GPS data-powered functions aligning using rules to pre-stated requirements so as to decide and select an algorithm to use. The AI remains aware of the user's limits, preferences and capabilities. The mode so selected can be changed again when situation calls for it. For example when a unit moves from a Christian region to an Islamic region the mode of interaction changes... for example the greetings.

        <h4> Machine Learning Opportunity; Dynamic Demographer Subsystem </h4>

          <p> Where more than one mode of operation is applicable e.g. when selecting appropriate culture to base advisory on in metropolitan areas where cultural hybridization is maximized. In such cases, Radar Safi engine presides over a democratic function-selection algorithm for maximization of targetted benefits like choosing shortest or best sounding words so that resultantly the culture is engineered effectively to serve stipulations as updated in pending-missions. Mode selection implies that our AI changes character according to need.

      <h3> Mission Selection </h3>

        <p> Major missions are fed into Radar Safi's databases dynamically from a pre-designed hash-tag based web-rooting system. The probing engine runs on policies formulated by AI-Jesus - an artificial intelligence platform designed for Mount Moses Observatory as documented in https://mountmosesobservatory.wordpress.com/AI-Jesus. Daily and seasonal trends of hash-tags are tallied alongside critical requirements towards establishment of a global kingdom on earth where love reigns. Strategic steering committees comprising of spiritual leaders and cultural experts arrives at consesus on best moves from which they give structurally guided recommendations that the AI uses together with skillset, resource data and progress logs to determine and prioritize critical missions for individuals and collectives. Recommendations are also based on regions and respective cultural orientations. Respective mission selection functions are arrived at after automatically triggered initiative and updated in respective databases so they are available as alternatives to feed the algorithm-flipping technology subsystem.
