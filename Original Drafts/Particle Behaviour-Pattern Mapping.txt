  <p> This is done in virtual-space and real-time with or without lags. Each event plots graphs of polaroids. Each alignment of the polaroids represents a mode of character, some patterns might be repeated in future events while some may not... probably like this for every individual, probably not. I may behave like this today and not behave in the same ever again... especially because particles can change behaviour patterns. Changes create maps, each individual unto his own... or her own?
