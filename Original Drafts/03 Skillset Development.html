    <h1> Glory to God </h1>
    <h2> Skillset Alignment </h2>
    <p> First of all we explore all the problems that are plaguing mankind these days, most of all we examine the extinction-level dangers, which communities find they have exposed themselves to because of adhering to false teachings. We delve into investigating how the things people do each day contributes to situations emanating from commitment to falsified ideals. We convert the information obtained into a database. Then we come up with a database of all skills available and respective valid motivation pointers.

  <h2> Declaration </h2> What is needed to be done is accurately targeted work by specialized teams. Our first step thus becomes identification of available skillsets.

  <h2> Tabulation of Available Skills </h2>
    <p> In the skillsets table, skills are tabulated alongside respective skill-levels in a field that automatically updates itself in response to progress, a field is provided for Artisan ID so that national artisanal and professional skill-data are suitably recorded for use by Radar Safi engine.

  <h2> Identification of Skill-Gaps </h2>
    <p> With the help of love we shall achieve this via targetted solutions. The goal is to channel available skills towards regeneration coupled with the generation of skills required for actual teamwork towards heaven, where heaven is for the living. Our deepest condolences to families of children deceived into believing that heaven is a place for the dead - got them seeking love in the wrong place. Love is required among the living, Heaven is for us to achieve.
