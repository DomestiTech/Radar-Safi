    <h2> THE YOUTH & RELIGION. </h2>
    <p> As times are changing so is the behavioral change in most of the gen z youths.First lets talk about the gender that is facing eradication or perhaps lets say distancing themselves from religion "the males'.This is the group that is best believed to conceal their problems due to the pride,lack of one to trust with such narrations,lack of support when neccesary and fear of becoming a laughingstack.The church might be considering itself warm welcoming bt might not be that warmwelcoming as it should.
The youth need things that keep them in cuorse bt yet they should be interesting to them like;camps,hikes,societiesand clubs.Some of the youths are facing internet related afflicts like watching pornography.Its been talked of in the near recent past from pulpits and whereever bt the solution to that has not been found yet.For instance that is an addict whereby to do away with it you need some counselling en guidence  your way out.social media is another thing though very informative most of the youths dont know how to go about it.Most of us the youth use it lucratively when bored or just need to see how their peers are fairing on.Sometime its a competetion for just lively fancies that the bible refers to fanity.Some are just facinated with the whole thing.It can be converted to better use if we get mentors who are going to advise us on such matters in relation to religiuos life.
And at number two we have another dangerous bt grolified "fornication".Most youths dont just come to church for spiritual orientation bt also make new friends who in the long run they ask out for a date.Its worrying because its the lifes of same that are at stake since nowadays diseases are rampant and their sexual behaviour is gonna be wanting at long last.
