    <p> Human life conditions itself according to what the adults let the children learn. In Radar Safi, the systems are open to stem curiosity-related exploits so we do not have to worry about the curious-type and radical hackers. Anyone that needs to understand how the system works and anyone that feels they can make a contribution shall find that teams are working to provide handles so that everyone's contribution is appreciated. Towards this end, a database of contributors is kept.

    <p> In eforcing safety and security, truth is told and maintained at all times so that children are not deceived about realities of life. This is done to ensure that generations are able to make informed decisions. As a contrary example, the common lie that is propagated in pseudo-Christian religions like Roman Catholicism, where social models thrive on telling children that their dead relatives have gone to be with the Lord and that the dead become saints like 'Holy Mary' and so on are strings of lies that have already claimed their toll in multiple places and times, <em>Shaka Holla</em> in Kenya (2023AD) being one among many other historical mass-suicide events. In such events the deceived have the notion that death is a doorway into heaven whereas in truth heaven is a situation we can co-create when we choose to live according to stipulations of Love. If you make people believe in lies you should expect drastic results. This is especially so because realities of life begin with what adults make children believe.
