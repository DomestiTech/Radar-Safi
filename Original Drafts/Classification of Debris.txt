    <h2>What is Debris?</h2>

      <p> Debris means leftovers, wasted material, not only from meals, not only of life in form of animal carcasses and plant debris, but also in unutilized silt, industrial waste, also in unutilized flows... rate of flow indicates level of demand. Level of wasting indicates level of social improvement. Corruption tries to conceal this. When everyone works in honesty and truth, all problems go away. That does not mean that they went away by themselves. When we have Debris, we have problems.

      <p> Below are illustrations to help interested parties understand how debris affect humanity and quality of life.
