Space-Time Coordinates

Knowing where you are requires two sets of variables. One set for the time or season and the other set for the place. Season depends on bodies. For example, a woman's body changes in cycles of roughly 30 days marked by the so-called 'periods'. The 30 days can be callibrated and marked appropriately, for example basing on body temperature variations. Our planet also goes through seasonal cycles that last roughly 360 days. Body temperature variations seem also as a suitable monitoring handle. Therefore, temperature changes can be recorded alongside days of the month or months a andlongside respective average temperatures and the data so obtained used to callibrate elements in the time dimension. Elements can include mood variations, rainfall intensity and so on.
