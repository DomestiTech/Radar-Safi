Dear Family - A poem by Henry N. Kaosa

I know that I am in your mind,
For you are in mine.
I know that you miss me,
For I miss you.

When I remember you,
The feeling overcomes my spirit,
When I try to forget,
It seems impossible.

I have learned patience,
Waiting is a wise move,
Till when I will have you in sight again,
When I will hear your voices ringing in my ears,
Telling me anything,
Everything.

In truth there is more to it
than can be expressed in writing.
That is why I often miss words,
to express how I feel.

Some times some things,
better go unmentioned,
Some times, some things,
better remain unchanged.

May we take care of one another,
Always.
