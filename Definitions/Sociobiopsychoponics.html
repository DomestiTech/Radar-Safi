    <h2> Sociobiopsychoponics Definition </h2>

    <p> Sociobiopsychoponics is basically mental adjustment whereby a qualified systems engineer endeavors to inform the public, sometimes among them relatives across age groups on the importance of maintaining love within and among communities. The engineer partakes to create solutions using all skills and prayers available until a situation of sustainable love is attained then she/he moves on to another region and so on while maintaining professional contact through Internet Enabled Devices.

    <p> The main goal of performing mental adjustments on individuals is to help them understand that life is powered by the words that come out of their respective mouths... if they plant curses into life they reap curses, if they plant blessings they reap blessings for them and for future generations. The discipline goes on further to advise engineers to serve without expecting to get paid by individuals and to pray that Love may open a way.
