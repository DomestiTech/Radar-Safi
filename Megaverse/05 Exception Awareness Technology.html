      <p><em>Mitigation Measures</em>

      <h3> Exception Awareness Technology </h3>
      <p> In flow-awareness technology teams of highly skilled geophysicists and other experts work from remote posts e.g. along forks and ridges characteristic of river-fronts. They collaborate with teams in other locations and rotate until a national fault-structure-formation map is constructed. Mitigation measures are coordinated with the help of the map and data from debriefed teams after initial exploration. The data so obtained is fed into Radar Safi engines via suitably constructed forms and necessary adjustments are effected.
