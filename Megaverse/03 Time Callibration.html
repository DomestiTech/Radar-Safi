    <h2> Callibrating Space-Time Coordinates; probing for <em>position</em> </h2>

    <h3> Introduction </h3>

    <p> Knowing your exact position requires three sets of variables. Two sets for the <em> time or season </em> basing on (a) body or vessel's config, (b) environment or (c) conventional ethics upheld, whereas the other set is for <em> space </em> - which can also be created in the time dimension logically by adjusting schedules. As can be shown, season usually depends on bodily functions, i.e. seasons change depending on what a body is doing currently. We can also say that bodies change depending on the season. In planets, the seasons depend on relative positions, velocities and trajectories in relation to other heavenly bodies; each with a unique mode and scale of influence. In a different set of terminologies, we can say that the personal and the collective are always in different time-frames.
    <p> As an example in humans, some people are living through mid-life crisis whereas others are going through adolescence and so on. A person can focus on their own lives as individuals or focus on collectives. Individual life is mentored by personal improvement whereas the collective is governed by spirits like love, hatred or indifference. At the same time we are all globally and cosmically going through periodic moments in history demarcated by cycles via revolutions and rotations of heavenly bodies with resultant changes in observable terrestrial seasons - which affect us in different ways - so we have to connect to one another to achieve perfection. Of utmost importance is that we become aware of our connections with the cosmic.
    <p> As an analogous example of our connectivity to the cosmic, a woman's body changes in cycles of roughly 30 days marked by the so-called 'monthly periods' - these 30 days can be callibrated and marked appropriately, for example basing on body temperature or hormone-balance variations. It pays to note that our planet goes through seasonal cycles that together last roughly 360 days. In both the cosmic and the human, temperature variations are a suitable monitoring handle because measuring can be done directly using callibrated instruments to obtain accurate data. Temperature changes can be recorded alongside days of the month or months alongside respective average temperatures. The data so obtained can be used to describe and callibrate elements in the time-dimension e.g. mood swings, levels of water tables, rainfall intensities, climate-change and so on.

    <h2> Callibrating Elements in the Time-Dimension </h2>

    <h3> Callibrating via Time-Management </h3>

    <p> This method is <em>applicable in situations where a body's mission is active with known adjustible polarisation and a log of previous polarizations</em>. When graphed and mapped over time, resultant polaroids are expected to create images similar to those of DNA strands under powerful microscopes. In a planet like ours, at any region away from absolute poles, time is cosmically divided into two sets separated by accessibility of region to photons from the sun. In regions near the equator - where duration of light balances almost exactly with duration of darkness, unions of individual sets of subsequent periods of darkness and periods of light have been called days by humans. Each day in the broader sense, i.e. from light to light, midnight to midnight or from evening to evening depending on culture, has been divided into 24 equal portions called hours. Each hour has been divided into 60 equal portions called minutes and each minute has been divided into 60 equal portions called seconds. The duration of a second can be illustrated.
